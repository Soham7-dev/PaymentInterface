### API KEY AUTHENTICATION AND CREATING A RAZORPAY ORDER FROM SERVER SIDE DJANGO

- We Create a Client Instance with api keys that was previously generated by us
- Later we create a Razorpay Client Order in our Server Side Django inside our index method inside views.py

### HANDLING PAYMENT IN THE SERVER SIDE

- Now we create another method (**Wrapped by @csrf_exempt decorator**) where we verify our **POST** request
- First we verify our **payment signature**
- if it succeeds we render **success.html** otherwise we render **failure.html**

### HANDLING PAYMENT IN THE CLIENT SIDE

- We have created a simple form where a person submits his name and donataes â‚¹100
- After Clicking the donation button Razorpay window pops up
- Here the donator gives his/her email address and phone no.

### PAYMENT STATUS PAGE

- if the payment succeeds we render **success.html** otherwise we render **failure.html**
- There is a link that Redirects the user to the First Page
